	Hello!
	<br>
	well, I know, a lot of fixes are to be made, 
	<br>
	Like the projects, achievements and alumni pages are not done yet. But I guess these pages could be finished fast.
	<br>
	And while opening from phone, some text is messed up in the sig list. i am still trying to fix it.
	sorry, i will put better images in the end
	<br>
	All the data shown in sig page are brought from json files.
	<br>
	from the team page, each member is a clickable link and will lead to a profile page.
	I wish to add links of his or her projects in the projects page into the profile page.
	<br>
	I have a small issue with the social media icons in the full_screen_menu on landscape mode, will fix it soon :)
	<br>generally, made it decently responsive.
	<br>btw some css files are scattered and will amke it collective.
	<br>
	but i m not spoiling it, <a href="index.html" title="">so open this link!</a>
