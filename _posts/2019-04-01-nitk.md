"I've never seen you smile so well when you're sober".

I get that a lot.

I was cross-fading, and the one thing I wanted to do right then was to cycle. It was back when Girls block night canteen had an amazing juice section. 

Missisipy mud never tasted better. 

Coasting through the empty roads, facing the wind and smiling.

That was one of the finest nights I had in nitk. It was our block party, and I remember earlier making countless sexist jokes to rishi. And roasting Vinay for losing for two votes. Honestly, I had no trouble laughing. I just could not smile.
