You know shit's real when you cannot tell this to a friend without fearing that he might actually do it.

Life is fun when you have someone like that. 

And trust me, life has been fun. Which is why as an appreciation to the kid who gave me hell lot of experience on a lot of things, I decided maybe I should add my share of things to probably the only noteworthy output he has ever made, his suicide note.

I guess the fact that the phrases like "Well I didn't see _this_ coming" and "How the fuck did _I_ reach _here_" have been used more frequent than ever by me both sober and drunk, explains sort of what my life was like for the past couple of months. 

There used to be countless nights when we were walking back from RedRock to campus, and I felt there wasn't really a reason for me to drink that night. We were drinking out of joblessness. I did not have any emotion, I was not feeling happy or sad or stressed, and we were wondering how empty our lives were. I am sure a lot of friends of mine would be judging me thinking I had become and alcoholic, and was resorting on booze to wash down my emotions. But even though I wasn't sure what I was going through, I knew enough to say that this wasn't the case. I wasn't sad, fuck you.

And that, along with slight motivation from Damu's We Who Drive The Time Machine, is when I started investing in creating emotions.
