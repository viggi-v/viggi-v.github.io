Even though VHDL is preferred over academia, industry prefers Verilog. Both are used for the same purpose and contains similar ideas, but I had started my learning from VHDL, abnd was a bit reluctant to shift to Verilog initially. So the first time I tried Verilog was as a part of our RTDSP(Real Time Digital Signal Processing) course, which was fun filled, discussing about lot of transforms in digital domain, different architectures of DSPs, different multiplication algorithms etc and finally trying out couple of stuff in Verilog and implementing it on FPGAs. 

The very first thing about Verilog that bothered me is just obvious, `wire`s vs `register`s.

The above statement would be relatable to anyone who tried out Verilog before, and for others, just know that this is a bit mess, and takes some time to understand.
